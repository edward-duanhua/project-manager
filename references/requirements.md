# Requirements Management (需求管理)

This module focuses on capturing, analyzing, documenting, and managing project requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

## Core Concepts

*   **Requirement Gathering**: Eliciting needs from stakeholders via interviews, workshops, or documentation analysis.
*   **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Clear acceptance criteria for each requirement.
*   **Prioritization**: Categorizing requirements (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have - MoSCoW).
*   **Scope Control**: Managing changes to the agreed-upon scope (Change Request process).

## Workflow

1.  **Understand the Problem**: Ask clarifying questions to fully grasp the user's intent and business need.
    *   *Example: "What is the primary goal of this feature?" "Who are the key users?"*
2.  **Break Down Requirements**: Decompose high-level features into specific, actionable user stories or tasks.
    *   *Example: "As a [User], I want to [Action], so that [Value]."*
3.  **Define Acceptance Criteria**: For each requirement, list the specific conditions that must be met for it to be considered complete.
    *   *Example: "Login page loads within 2 seconds. Error message displays for incorrect password."*
4.  **Validate**: Confirm understanding with the stakeholder.

## Templates

### Requirement Document Structure

1.  **Project Background**: Brief overview.
2.  **Objectives**: SMART goals.
3.  **Key Stakeholders**: Who is involved.
4.  **Functional Requirements**: Specific features and behaviors.
5.  **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability.
6.  **Constraints & Assumptions**: Limitations and dependencies.

### Change Request (CR) Process

When a scope change is requested:
1.  **Assess Impact**: Time, Cost, Quality, Resources.
2.  **Document**: Capture the change details and justification.
3.  **Approval**: Obtain sign-off from the Change Control Board (CCB) or Project Sponsor.
4.  **Implement**: Update project plan and execute.
