# Schedule Management (进度管理)

This module outlines the strategy for creating, tracking, and maintaining a project schedule.

## Core Concepts

*   **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Decomposing deliverables into smaller, manageable tasks.
*   **Milestones**: Key checkpoints in the project timeline.
*   **Critical Path**: The longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the overall project duration.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Comparing planned progress vs. actual progress.

## Workflow

1.  **Define Tasks**: List all activities required to complete project deliverables (WBS).
    *   *Example: "Design phase: Create wireframes, review with stakeholders."*
2.  **Estimate Duration**: Assign realistic time estimates to each task, considering buffers.
    *   *Technique: PERT (Optimistic, Pessimistic, Likely).*
3.  **Sequence Tasks**: Identify dependencies (FS - Finish-to-Start, SS - Start-to-Start, FF - Finish-to-Finish, SF - Start-to-Finish).
    *   *Example: "Development cannot start until Design is approved."*
4.  **Develop Schedule**: Create a timeline (Gantt chart) visualizing tasks, durations, and dependencies.
5.  **Set Milestones**: Define major progress points.
    *   *Example: "M1: Requirements Sign-off (Date)."*
6.  **Monitor & Control**: Regularly update actual progress and compare against the baseline schedule.
    *   *Metrics: Planned vs Actual % Complete, Variance Analysis.*

## Templates

### Project Schedule Structure

1.  **Milestone Plan**: High-level timeline.
2.  **Detailed Task List**: Specific activities with owners and dates.
3.  **Dependency Matrix**: Task relationships.
4.  **Resource Assignments**: Who is doing what.

### Progress Report Section

- **Overall Status**: Red/Amber/Green (RAG).
- **Milestone Achievement**: Completed vs Planned.
- **Schedule Variance**: Ahead/Behind schedule (days).
- **Next Steps**: Focus for the upcoming period.
