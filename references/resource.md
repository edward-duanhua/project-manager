# Resource Management (资源调配)

This module focuses on planning, acquiring, and managing the resources (people, equipment, budget) required for successful project delivery.

## Core Concepts

*   **Resource Planning**: Determining what resources (people, equipment, materials) are needed and in what quantities.
*   **Acquisition**: Securing the necessary resources (internal/external).
*   **Team Development**: Improving competencies, team interaction, and the overall team environment.
*   **Resource Control**: Ensuring resources are available as planned and monitoring their actual vs. planned usage.

## Workflow

1.  **Estimate Activity Resources**: For each activity, determine the type and quantity of resources required.
    *   *Example: "Frontend Developer x 2, Designer x 1, Server x 1."*
2.  **Acquire Resources**: Obtain the team members, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, and other resources necessary to complete project work.
    *   *Negotiate with functional managers.*
3.  **Develop Team**: Improve competencies, team interaction, and the overall team environment to enhance project performance.
    *   *Training, team-building activities, ground rules, colocation/recognition.*
4.  **Manage Team**: Track team member performance, provide feedback, resolve issues, and manage team changes.
    *   *Performance appraisals, conflict management.*
5.  **Control Resources**: Ensure that the physical resources assigned and allocated to the project are available as planned, as well as monitoring the planned versus actual utilization of resources and taking corrective action as necessary.
