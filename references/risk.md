# Risk Management (风险评估)

This module provides a framework for identifying, assessing, and responding to project risks.

## Core Concepts

*   **Risk Identification**: Systematically finding potential events that could impact the project.
*   **Qualitative Analysis**: Assessing probability and impact.
*   **Quantitative Analysis**: Numerical estimation of risk exposure.
*   **Risk Response Planning**: Developing strategies to address risks.
*   **Monitoring**: Tracking identified risks and identifying new ones.

## Workflow

1.  **Identify Risks**: Brainstorm potential threats and opportunities with stakeholders.
    *   *Tools: Brainstorming, SWOT, Checklists, Interviews.*
2.  **Assess Risks**: Analyze the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact on project objectives.
    *   *Matrix: Probability (Low, Medium, High) x Impact (Low, Medium, High).*
3.  **Prioritize Risks**: Rank risks based on their severity (risk score).
    *   *High-Probability/High-Impact risks require immediate attention.*
4.  **Plan Responses**: Develop strategies to manage prioritized risks.
    *   *Avoid: Eliminate the threat.*
    *   *Transfer: Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).*
    *   *Mitigate: Reduce probability or impact.*
    *   *Accept: Acknowledge the risk but take no action unless it occurs (contingency plan).*
5.  **Monitor & Control**: Regularly review the risk register, track trigger conditions, and update response plans.

### Risk Register Structure

1.  **Risk ID**: Unique identifier.
2.  **Description**: What is the risk? Cause & Effect.
3.  **Category**: Technical, External, Organizational, PM.
4.  **Probability**: 1-5 or L/M/H.
5.  **Impact**: 1-5 or L/M/H.
6.  **Risk Score**: P x I.
7.  **Response Strategy**: Avoid/Transfer/Mitigate/Accept.
8.  **Owner**: Who is responsible.
9.  **Status**: Open, Closed, Occurred.
